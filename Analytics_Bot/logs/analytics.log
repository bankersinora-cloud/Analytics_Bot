2025-11-24 12:13:58,838 - INFO - USER QUERY: Which transporter has the best load utilisation?
2025-11-24 12:14:06,431 - INFO - RESULT: To determine which transporter has the best load utilization, we can analyze the `day_wise_summary` table, specifically focusing on the columns related to transporters and their performance metrics. 

The relevant columns in the `day_wise_summary` table include:
- `transporter_id`: Identifies the transporter.
- `vehicle_requested`: The number of vehicles requested.
- `vehicle_assigned`: The number of vehicles assigned.
- `trip_count`: The total number of trips made.
- `trip_fulfilled`: The number of trips that were fulfilled.

Load utilization can be calculated as the ratio of `vehicle_assigned` to `vehicle_requested`, and we can also consider the ratio of `trip_fulfilled` to `trip_count` to assess the effectiveness of the trips.

To find the transporter with the best load utilization, we would typically calculate these ratios for each transporter and then rank them accordingly. 

If you would like, I can provide a query to retrieve this information from the database. Would you like me to proceed with that?...

2025-11-24 12:17:01,027 - INFO - RESULT: To upload a Proof of Delivery (POD) for a trip, you would typically follow these steps based on the EPOD workflow:

1. **Prepare the Document**: Ensure that the POD document is ready for upload. This could be in various formats such as PDF, image files, etc.

2. **Access the EPOD System**: Log into the EPOD system where you manage trip documents.

3. **Locate the Trip**: Find the specific trip for which you want to upload the POD. This can usually be done by searching for the trip ID or number.

4. **Upload the Document**:
   - Use the upload functionality provided in the system. You will need to select the document file from your device.
   - Fill in any required fields such as document type (e.g., EPOD), remarks, and any other relevant information.

5. **Submit the Document**: After filling in the necessary details, submit the document. The system will typically save the document and link it to the corresponding trip.

6. **Verification**: Once uploaded, the document may go through a verification process. You can check the status of the upload to ensure it has been successfully processed.

7. **Review and Confirmation**: After the document is verified, you should receive a confirmation that the POD has been successfully uploaded and linked to the trip.

This workflow ensures that all necessary documentation is properly managed and associated with the respective trips, facilitating smooth logistics operations....

2025-11-24 12:20:26,592 - INFO - RESULT: To calculate the average auction fill time, we would typically look at the relevant metrics in the `day_wise_summary` table. However, the specific column for auction fill time is not explicitly listed in the schema provided.

The `day_wise_summary` table includes various metrics related to trips and indents, such as:
- `indent_count`
- `indent_accepted`
- `indent_fulfilled`
- `trip_count`
- `trip_fulfilled`

To derive the average auction fill time, we would need to analyze the time taken for indents to be accepted and fulfilled, which may involve calculating the difference between the time an indent was created and the time it was accepted or fulfilled.

If you have a specific definition or formula for "auction fill time," please provide that, and I can help you further with the analysis. Otherwise, we may need to explore additional data or metrics related to auction processes in the database....
